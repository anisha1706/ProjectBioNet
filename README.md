# ProjectBioNet

## Overview
This project investigates the co-localization and communication pathways between specific CD8+ T cell and cDC subpopulations in melanoma mouse models. The study aims to understand how cDCs recruit CD8+ T cell progenitors, which then produce effector cells to infiltrate and kill tumors.
